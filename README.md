Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is systematic way of applying engineering principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems which involves software product design, development, tetsing deployment and maintenance.
importance of software engineering in technology industry are; it enables creation of software applications and system that power various aspects of modern life 
it helps in communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as fortran, c etc.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. Advent of structuring programing in the 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement
Design: This is the act of creating high-level and detailed designs of the architecture and user interface.
Implemetation: writing of codes and building the software according to design specification.
Testing: this is done to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployments:  revealing the software to users or customers
Miantenace: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployments.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall, it may include following the due software development life cycle. it is appropriate for use in a sample project or a one time use project.
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach which is focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes. this is appropriate for use in a continuous project like that og google software, microsoft softwares.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality assuance engineer: ensures the quality of software by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Deveklopment Environments are softwrae suites that provide compehensive tools for writing, debugging and tetsing code e.g eclipse, Visual studio, kotlin
Version Control System are control system used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g subversion Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirement
Tight deadlines 
Technical Debt
the strategies to overcom these challenges are:
effective comminication
Agile methodology
Prioritization of task
regualar assessment of Project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: this is the testing of individual components of modules of software.
Integration Testing: It is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystem.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is an act of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
importance of prompt engineering is as relevant as architecture work in building and construction, some of its includes;
1. it helps avoid vague questions
2. minimize the rate of getting a confusing responses
3. it also helps mark questions clear and specific so AI can understand exactly what one needs 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is china?  - vague prompt
which continent is china located? improved prompt
the improved prompt is clear, specific and concise
